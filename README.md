# neotemplate
A basic neoctites website template.

This will be much easier if you have some basic knowledge of css and html. 
I advise at least doing the catphotoapp course on the new (or legacy) responsive web design course on freecodecamp first. 
(It is 100% free, no adverts.)

To use.

1. Set up a neocities website.

2. Make files with the same names used in this template aside from the css and index file. i.e. links, photos and nav.

3. Go to the neocities .css file, delete everything then past the .css code used in these github files. Go to the .html index file and do the same. 
Make a new javascript file with the code in the .js file here.

4. This website works as only an index page. But since you've got a page navigation bar it is worth making more pages on your website it can navigate to.
To make a new webpage click 'new file' button, it needs to be a .html file. To make things easy, select all the default neocities code in the file, then delete. Copy and paste the index page code to this file. Edit the page as you wish.

5. To make the navigation work you will need to change the names of the links used in the html files. For example, if you have a new html page called links.html.
This code from the template,
<a href="https://neotemplate.neocities.org/links.html">Links</a> 
will have to become,
<a href="https://yoursitename.neocities.org/links.html">Links</a>
yoursitename being whatever you are naming the website.

5. Before doing any heavy customisation, I advise doing more on the freecodecamp new or legacy responsive web design course.
It will be easier to edit your website. 

FAQ

'My css code keeps reverting to an older version!'

Neocities is a bit weird at times and you will need to clear your cache a lot. If your css code reverts to an older version and you know you
saved the new version, exit the window (don't save anything) and clear your cache. When you go back to the css file it will be the new version.

'My changes aren't showing on my webpage'

Again, if you saved the changes try clearing your cache.


'I broke something I don't know how to fix'

Try this HTML validator. https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea
If you still don't know what is wrong, I advise copy pasting the error messages into a search engine.
With css 90% of the time you added or deleted an important bracket.


'I keep getting the 'not found' page'

One of your links is broken, check the link you followed in the html editor. Is it leading to the right place?


'Can I have a more detailed explanation of this?'

If we are friends then I am happy to help. However I don't have unlimited time and spoons, so otherwise look up online 'how to use neocities' or look at the w3 schools website's pages on CSS and HTML. Mozzilla's refrence pages are also useful.
