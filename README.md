# neotemplate
A basic neoctites website template

To use.

1. Set up a neocities website.

2. Make files with the names used in this template aside from the css and index file. i.e. links, photos and nav.

3. Select all on the neocities files, delete everything then past the code used in these github files. 

3. Make sure you end the file names with the same file names used here. HTML files must stay as HTML files, js files as js files.

4. To make this work you will need to change the names of the links used in the html files. i.e.  
<a href="https://neotemplate.neocities.org/links.html">Links</a> 
will have to become
 <a href="https://yoursitename.neocities.org/links.html">Links</a>

5. Before doing any heavy customisation,
I strongly advise you go though at least the 'build a catphotoapp and build a cafe menu section of freecodecamp new responsive web design. 
That will give you the basics in HTML and CSS.

FAQ

'My code keeps reverting to an older version!'

Neocities is a bit weird at times and you will need to clear your cache a lot. If your code reverts to an older version and you know you
saved the new version, exit the window (don't save anything) and clear your cache. When you go back to the file it will be the new version.


'I broke something I don't know how to fix'

Try this HTML validator. https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea
If you still don't know what is wrong, I advise copy pasting the error messages into a search engine.

With css 90% of the time you added or deleted a bracket.


'I keep getting the not found page'

One of your links is broken, check the link you followed in the html editor. Is it leading to the right place?


'How do I add new pages?'

1. click 'new file' name it accordingly. Remember the .html.

2. I advise copy pasting the code from another html page file and editing it so the new page is styled how you want it. 

3. Add a link to it to the navbar code on every other html file. 

4. You have a new page.


'Can I have a more detailed explanation of this?'

If we are friends then I am happy to help. However I don't have unlimited time and spoons, so otherwise look up online 'how to set up a neocities' 
and again free code camp is your friend.
