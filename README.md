# neotemplate
A basic neoctites website template

To use.

1. Set up a neocities website.

2. Make files with the same names used in this template aside from the css and index file. i.e. links, photos and nav.

3. Go to the neocities css file, delete everything then past the css code used in these github files. Go to the index file and do the same.

3. Make sure you keep the file types the same.

4. To make the links work you will need to change the names of the links used in the html files. i.e.  
<a href="https://neotemplate.neocities.org/links.html">Links</a> 
will have to become,
 <a href="https://yoursitename.neocities.org/links.html">Links</a>
 You will also need to make a new HTML file with the name 'links'.

5. Before doing any heavy customisation,
I strongly advise you go though at least the 'build a catphotoapp and build a cafe menu section of freecodecamp new responsive web design. 
That will give you the basics in HTML and CSS.

FAQ

'My css code keeps reverting to an older version!'

Neocities is a bit weird at times and you will need to clear your cache a lot. If your css code reverts to an older version and you know you
saved the new version, exit the window (don't save anything) and clear your cache. When you go back to the css file it will be the new version.

'My changes aren't showing on my webpage'

Again, if you saved the changes try clearing your cache.


'I broke something I don't know how to fix'

Try this HTML validator. https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea
If you still don't know what is wrong, I advise copy pasting the error messages into a search engine.
With css 90% of the time you added or deleted an important bracket.


'I keep getting the 'not found' page'

One of your links is broken, check the link you followed in the html editor. Is it leading to the right place?


'How do I add new web pages?'

1. click 'new file' name it accordingly. Remember the .html.

2. I advise copy pasting the code from another html page file and editing it so the new page is styled how you want it. 

3. Add a link to it to the navbar code on the rest of your html files.

4. You have a new page.


'Can I have a more detailed explanation of this?'

If we are friends then I am happy to help. However I don't have unlimited time and spoons, so otherwise look up online 'how to use neocities' or look at the w3 schools website's pages on CSS and HTML. Mozzilla's refrence pages are also useful.
